Âµ## Trolly Fish
Trolly fish is like an endless runner, where you need to dodge the enemies, collect stars and use powerups to progress as far as you can.

We need a good balance between stars to catch and enemies.

* the main character is a fish drying to dodge ... aquatic stuff
* 3 enemies
  * Eel: swimming straight at a fixed speed
  * Bad Fishy: swimming in small bursts
  * jellyfish: going up and than floats down again, go up and float down again, while moving towards the player.
* starfish will give you points
* 8 powerups (fits exact 1 byte)
