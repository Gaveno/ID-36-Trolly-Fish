## Things not to forget
- reset difficulty and other variables when a new game starts
- make a better game-over screen
- make a pause screen
- swap A B button
- remove the lowest lane of enemies
- add some kind of small seaweed at the bottom of the screen
- maybe add a large seaweed at the left side of the screen with bubbles ?
